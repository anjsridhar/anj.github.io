When I started my undergraduate studies, there was so much to learn. I was fascinated by electrical circuits, quantum physics and english literature. The first few years are on warp drive with semesters blending into each other and before you know you are graduating.

Looking back I feel there are critical questions that all students must ask themselves about what they are learning. Knowledge can fall into a couple of different buckets depending on who you are and what you are looking for. If you want to learn and learn anything than taking a host of different classes will fill that unabated thirst for knowledge. If you are looking to learn just enough to get your degree so that you can get out in the real world, then there are classes that you can take and get on with "life". Ideally you want to be somewhere in the middle where you have the best of both worlds and are able to temper that thirst for knowledge with the right reality check. So now we ask ourselves, what can we learn at college that will be useful in the real world?

It is often the case that you won't remember the details of all your technical courses. Most of the midterms and finals will be hazy by the time you graduate. What you will remember is the existence of certain ideas and where you can go find them. The best analogy I can think of is that you spend 4+ years learning about the milky way and when you start working in your first job, you realize that you are only looking at a single planet(or maybe half a planet :)). You'll end up going deeper into an area and most likely learning about it. With this kind of a depth-breadth conundrum, what can you learn in college that will help you at your first job?

# Scripting, scripting and more scripting

Dev tooling is something that you should start learning and getting a hang of right in college. By dev tooling I don't mean the large scale build and test infra that you might be introduced to in your job. Dev tooling can also start with very simple things like learning about shell scripting. Something that I found terribly useful was to identify productivity tools early on such as tmux and shell scripting. If you are working on a product time, it is most likely that you will be asked to deep dive into job logs. Without a good command on shell scripting, chances are that you will spend more time than required on getting to root cause. Shell scripting is a way to shave off those extra minutes that you spend either on typing routing commands or performing batch operations. Learning these commands early and using them is something I found very useful in those early days.

# I love my IDE(for now)

Another critical is to figure out what is the best development environment for you and to stick to it. It is very common to switch IDEs, languages and every thing that comes with it if it is the newest thing on the market. Every time you switch you invariable will have some cognitive load to figure out what the new workflows, shortcut keys and commands are. This can slow you down on your regular task. When picking an IDE or language, understand what the pros and cons are. If an IDE is really powerful but requires a lot of compute, you might want to figure out if you really use all the loaded tools. Would something simpler suffice? These are also the questions you want to ask yourself when you consider moving to a new dev environment. At the end of the day you want your development environment to be maintained, (community) supported and be usable.

# I write down everything

In college you often have a semester of classes where there is a syllabus and you are graded on homework and exams. There is a finite timeline and deliverable that is set forth right at the beginning. A job is very far from being well defined. You often have multiple projects at various states of progress with tasks ranging from an hour to a couple of months. How do you optimize on time and impact? A key skill to start working on in college is what I call meticulous book-keeping. If you get into the habit of recording your work in an organized manner, you'll probably have an easier time ramping up at work. The recording of your work is useful for two reasons - first, it tells you exactly what you have done and how long it took and second, you will be able to produce this as evidence to your team in the real world. The other advantage of this is that you can often use this as a rubber duck to enable better debugging (stay tuned for a later post on this). Writing helps you analyze what you are thinking in ways that talking does not.

These are a few things that I found useful when I started off at work after graduating from college! Drop me a note at ... if you have found other things useful as well.
