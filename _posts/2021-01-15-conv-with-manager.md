Starting a new job after college comes with an entire slew of new things to learn. Industry is very different than academia both in terms of relationships and expectations. In the industry, a manager can serve different roles depending on the company and team you end up working for. Different managers focus on different things for their employees and employ different means of communication pathways. 

After a couple of years in the industry, you end up having worked with a couple of different managers and get the hang of it. Managers usually end up performing some or all of the below functions:

* Career development of team members
* Maintaining and enforcing good culture among team members
* Interfacing with internal and external teams
* Identifying gaps at the macro level and suggesting methods to improve them
* High level strategy and planning of the future of the team

Some times a manager may be working with a TL or a Program Manager in which case some of these responsibilities will be overlapped or secondary for your manager.

Initially when you start working in a team, the focus for you and your manager will be onboarding you. Onboarding is a term used to describe anything and everything that involves getting you familiar with the company, team and your role.

During onboarding you might have had questions about the team, organizational structure or other misc questions. Once you are done onboarding, what should you focus on? From your perspective your manager provides the following:

# Helps you resolve conflicts within and outside your team.

Given that you are going to be working with a lot of people conflict is inevitable. This is one of the things that I found was very different than studying in a university or doing research. In undergrad and masters, my course work projects were always with my friends. People I knew and got along with. I rarely had to work with people I did not know socially. Research on the other hand is such a solo endeavor that you end up interacting with your advisor and at the most another graduate student. You are rarely in a position where you have to present ideas, get consensus and resolve any doubts that people might have. I can spend this entire post talking about conflicts since it is such a messy and tangled term. 

For now, let's just say that any time you find yourself disagreeing in an unhealthy fashion with a coworker, you should raise it with your manager. Your manager will probably have a bird's eye view of the situation and will be able to give you some perspective and also advice on how to handle it. It is often the case that it is a matter of communication and incorrect assumptions that lead to strained communication patters on the team. This is definitely a use case for leveraging your manager and trying to clear the air.

# Sets clear expectations for what is needed for your current job level and gives you timely feedback.

Getting feedback from people is not very easy. The most likely thing you will hear is "You are doing great" "Everything is good" "No issues, nothing comes to mind". These are all great to hear but once the performance reviews roll in, the tone could be very different. The reason is two fold:
1. Your manager did not think deeply enough about what you were doing and how well you were doing it. 
2. Your manager was heavily influenced by peer review or other team member's feedback about you at performance review time.

To avoid being blindsided you need to be able to elicit feedback which is an art. How do you get people to tell you things that is fundamentally uncomfortable? Your first line of feedback is your manager so ask him/her specifically about your role and its expectations. To do this really well, you need to understand what the expectations are and what are some examples of people actually meeting and exceeding these expectations. Frame your questions in these terms and identify which axis is not going well. When your questions are specific about a skill or growth axis, you will definitely get some feedback on how to do better. Another way is you to volunteer an example of a recent task where you felt like you could do better. That is a great way to get people to open up to you. Asking for specific feedback also shows your manager that you are interested to grow in your role and welcome positive feedback.

# Helps you identify what is needed for you to grow into the next level and helps you take on projects that align with identified goals.

This follows from the previous point of being well versed with what is expected for your current role. Once you are satisfied that you are a strong engineer in the current role, in order to continue growth you must think of the next level. Study the expectations and  have a discussion with your manager about what kind of projects will satisfy the expectations of the next level. This is an important time for you to self reflect and identify what you want to learn. The main question you want to ask your manager is if the current tasks you are working on align with the next level. Expectations are usually along multiple dimensions - technical depth, expertise, cross functional work etc. Figuring out this expectation grid with your manager will help you figure out whether you are working on the right thing and if not, what should you be working on?

# Has a global picture of how the larger organization is working and the interdependence of your team on others.

The previous three points have mainly focussed on your growth and daily working in the team. However your manager is also a great resource for you learn about other people in the organization. Ask questions about the team strategy and where the organization is headed. Find out more about what people are working on. As you grow in your career and role, you will move from being assigned projects to developing projects on your own. Having this kind of broad insight will help you make the right kind of project choices. It is also a great way to identify gaps in your team and organization and raise the attention level on these gaps. 1:1 is also a great way for you to talk to your manager about your ideas and things you are thinking of.

In order to have fruitful 1:1s, one thing that has helped me is preparing for the meeting. I usually take some time before the meeting to check in on what we last spoke about and reflect on what I need to bring. Maintain an agenda doc and it's possible that only you will update it. 

The most important thing is to make sure that you are clear about what you need to deliver and to make sure you are working on tasks that will lead to expected results.
